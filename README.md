# JavaApplication_IAC_Local
Deploy java application on multiple virtual machines consisting of Centos 9 and ubuntu. For this project I am using MYSQL for local storage, MEMCACHED for database caching, RABBITMQ for message queueing, TOMCAT 9 for deploying/building Java application and  NGINX as load balancer.
